I built a portfolio project to demonstrate BI skills in a PropTech context.

The scenario: a fictional property management company wants to understand performance of their Resident Benefits Package—things like renters insurance, credit building, and filter delivery services.

What I did:
• Generated realistic sample data (6,500 residents, 35 properties, 22K+ benefit enrollments)
• Wrote SQL queries for validation, core metrics, cohort analysis, and churn investigation
• Documented findings with specific, actionable recommendations
• Spec'd out a Looker Studio dashboard

The analysis surfaced two main insights: one market showing 16% higher churn than the others, and a clear correlation between early benefit activation and retention.

I designed this with Second Nature in mind—their Resident Experience Platform is doing interesting work in this space, and I wanted to show I understand the domain.

If you work in PropTech analytics or resident services, I'd be curious to hear what metrics you find most useful for measuring RBP success.
